# Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS)

This repository contains all my learnings, notes, and problem-solving practice from the **Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS)** course offered at **KLE Tech University**. The goal of this course is to strengthen foundational skills in algorithms, data structures, and real-world computational thinking.

## 🌐 Live APS Portfolio

I’ve also created a portfolio page that highlights business problems, optimized solutions, and learnings from this course:
👉 **[APS Portfolio](https://sanjanapatil22.github.io/APS/)**

This portfolio showcases selected problems, approach diagrams, time-space analysis, and reflections, all neatly organized for review and sharing.
